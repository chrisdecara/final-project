            <article id="venuscontent">
                <p>Ah, Venus! To many, Venus is nothing more than a massive ball of fire that rests in the night sky, reminding us all to turn our intergalactic ovens off at night. But to some, Venus is more: it's also a death trap.</p>
                <p>Yes, to the average alien like myself, Venus is somewhat of a problem. Its magnetic center is aligned in a way that perfectly obstructs navigational equpimnet onboard spacecraft, often causing personnel to panic and steer the ship directly into the planet's surface. It's... not ideal.</p>
                <p>Hover your cursor over the chart below to see just how detrimental Venus has been to different species.</p>
